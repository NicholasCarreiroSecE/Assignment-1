//-------------------------- Implementation Choices hobby_website.html
First I will go over the implementation decisions in the hobby_website html.
For the hobby_website html I first used essential elements like the html, head and body tag to give my document the most basic structure.
In my head section I use tags like title to change the tab name of my website and link in order to externally style my html file using a css file so that my files are better organized not having to code and style in the same file
Next in the body section I use semantic elements to separate my sections with the use of div class="container" , "row", "header", "content", and "card",   in order to then layout my site using my css styling.
Under my header div class I use a mix of h1 for my title and p and strong tags for my text directly under the title to give it some depth.
Using my div class="card" I can arrange my main information to be alligned in specific ways and using specific colours for certain sections.
With the use of the img and iframe tags I can embed my images and videos into my site using various rooth paths and embedded links and then use styling later to configure their sizes and positions.
In order to convey a list of my favourites games I use the unordered list to put a bullet point list where I can then list those games in no particular order.
Next I use a table to categorize my top 3 favourite games with the collum heads of title, rating and description. In ths table I also make use of the a href tag to embed a link that brings you directly to where those games could be purchased under the name of the title.
After that comes the footer section that contains a link to a local path file where my gane submission form is hosted.

//--------------------------- Design Choices hobby_website.css
The use of styling the html with margin and padding 0px is to keep a consistent layout across different broswer by deleting default values of the browser.
Next comes the box sizing, font family and background colour which changes the look of the entire website and sets a colour pallette for the site using darker colours and white text.
In the styling for the first header I use a circular border achieves using various border and margin tags to set my desired size for the layout and position of my main title, also using background colour to fill in that border using the colour gray which gives good undertones for the black background.
Next comes the container, container row, andcontainer row header where I set the width, background colour and margins which allows me to set specifically where I want my text and images to fall on the screen.
After that I set the font size and colour for my main header.
I now set the sizes for my images and videos under img and iframe which will even everything out since they are originally different sizes because of the different resolutions.
I can now use the content, content card, and content card h4 tage to set exactly where I want my paragraphs and images go in relation to eactother allowing them to be in the same row and having their associated text directly below each image using my display and flex tags.
Next comes the h2, tr, table, tr:nth-child(odd), and th styling. I use text align to align all the text in the table to the center of their cells and make the text white. I also create a border for the table and its cells that fits into the theme.
Last comes the footer where I use a combination of borders, margin, height, width, and colouring in order to achieve a box that contains the embeded link to the local file that has my recommentaion form.

//--------------------------- Implementaion choices contact_form.html
In the contact form html file I first give the essential structuring for html files with html, head, and body tags
Under the head section contains my title for the name of my tab along with the link to the css stylesheet to externally style this file.
In my body comes the the header and paragraph that let the user know what to do on the site.
Then comes a table that easily allows me to arrange the needed inputs and buttons to where I want them to go.
In my table I use input tag three times in order to get the users information on their review, such as game title, game rating and game description.
After my inputs comes my submit button that enters in the information once the user has entered in into the input and clicked the button. The button prompts the user with an alert that thanks them for their recommendation and review.
//--------------------------- Design choices contact_form.html
In the styling of my contact form I opt to keep the same colour pallette of my main website in order to maintain the cohesion of the two sites.
First I set the background once again to black which I will later use lighter colours to compliment the darker background.
Next I style my main header with a combination of border, margin, colour, and centering tags to achieve a nice border and location in the middle of the site that welcomes the user.
I then style my paragraph by increasing the font size and changing the colour to be able to see against the dark background and then align it to the center aswell.
Next I style my input and buttons alltogether giving them all a uniform look and location
Using margins, borders, colours, and paddings im able to center all my inputs and button, every one below the last and give a nice clean and easy to use experience for the user to easily submit a review.
